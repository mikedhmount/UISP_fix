This script is used to fix the issue with the nanobeams 100% cpu usage. Requires UDM or another OpenVPN server onsite. Uses Ubiquiti UISP API to find devices that are at 100%, ssh into device and kills the udapi-bridge process causing the issue. Saves from having to dispatch a tech to reset device.
